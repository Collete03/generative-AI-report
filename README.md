AI creation initial trial run
Author: collete03
Date: September 20, 2025

**1. Objective**

To explore, create and document the use of generative AI tools and their real life applications.

**2. Tools used**

- ChatGPT
- Jaseci Labs
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub
- Deepseek
- Ubuntu

**3. Key Concepts**

- AI creation: Building AI models that can tackle real-world problems and tasks.
- AI testing: Pacing AI to make to make sure it gives reliable results and functions well.  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Teaching AI to understand and interact using human language.  
- Model training: Feeding data into AI systems to make them better over time and enhance learning.
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning up and organising data before using it to train AI models.
- Generative AI & prompting: Using prompts to guide AI models to create texts, images, videos or other contents.
- Deployment: Rolling out AI models so that they can be used in real life situations.

**4. Observations**

- Tools intergrated well but requires time to setup
- Model output strongly affected by quality of the prompts.
- Refined inputs improves generative responses.
- Stable environment for model training is provided by Ubuntu.
- For code editing and debugging Visual Studio Code is ideal for that process.

**5. Conclusion**

- The trial successfully demonstrated the AI creation pipeline.
- The impact of prompt design and tool synergy was learnt.
- Setting a foundation for future AI development and fine tuning.
- Building and improving AI applications that can respond intelligently and adapt to real-world cases is the goal.
